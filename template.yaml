welcome: Welcome to memory game. I'm going to say a list of colors for you to repeat back. Each time you get it right I'll add one color. Ready?

round: New color: {{color[-1]}}. Can you repeat all the colors?

win: Good job! You could remember up to 20 colors!

lose: Sorry, the correct answer was {{ colors|join(", ") }}.
